# Causes of Depression: Statistical Analysis

## Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between various socio-economic, occupational, and personal factors contributing to depression. It employs statistical methods, including Chi-Square Tests and General and Multiple Logistic Regression, to explore key predictors such as financial stress, job satisfaction, sleep duration, and work hours.

## Research Highlights

**Primary Focus**: Identifying factors associated with depression.

## Key Variables:

**Demographic**: Age, Gender
**Occupational**: Job Satisfaction, Work Pressure, Work Hours
**Personal**: Sleep Duration, Family Mental Health History, Financial Stress
**Statistical Methods**: Chi-Square Tests, Logistic Regression (Binary & Multivariate)

## Dataset

**Source**: Kaggle - Depression Professional Dataset
**Records**: 2,056 individuals
**Attributes**: 11 features including demographic, occupational, and mental health indicators.

## Key Findings

**Financial Stress**: Strong predictor of depression, with higher levels significantly increasing depression risk.
**Job Satisfaction**: Complex and nuanced relationship where both very dissatisfied and highly satisfied individuals showed unexpected depression patterns.
**Work Hours & Sleep Duration**: Long work hours increased depression risk, while adequate sleep decreased it.
**Family Mental Health History**: No statistically significant impact on depression in this study.

## Methods & Tools

**Languages**: R (for statistical analysis)
**Libraries Used**: ggplot2, dplyr, broom, psych, rstatix, tidyverse, and more.
**Statistical Techniques**: Chi-Square Test, Logistic Regression, Odds Ratio Computation

## Conclusion

The project highlights the multidimensional nature of depression and emphasizes the need for integrated policies targeting financial, occupational, and personal stressors.
